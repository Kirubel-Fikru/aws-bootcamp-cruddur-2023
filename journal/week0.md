## AWS Billing and Free Tier
### Walkthrough
* Billing Dashboard

* **Creating Billing alarm** :There are two ways of creating a billing alarm
	*  Old  Method :  Billing Preference => Email/Free tier Usage alerts/Recieve Alert
	*  New Method: Cloud watch (Only in northern virginia) =>  Alarms => in alarm => Create alarm => Select metrics => Billing => Total estimated charges => Select metrics=> Metric name/currency/statstics/period/Conditions(Threshold value) => Next => Notification (Email end point) =>Create alarm

*  **Cost allocation Tags** (Key value pairs)  :A tag is a label that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and a value. For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value. You can use tags to organize your resources, and cost allocation tags to track your AWS costs on a detailed level. After you activate cost allocation tags, AWS uses the cost allocation tags to organize your resource costs on your cost allocation report, to make it easier for you to categorize and track your AWS costs.  To create CaT:  
	*  Go to a Service (EC2) => Tags => Manage tags (Key/Value) => Save => Go to Billing Service => Cost allocation tag => Activate
* 	**Cost Explorer** : AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. We can use report parameters to  filter our search.
* 	**Report**: The Reports page provides default reports. You can also create new reports with existing templates. The reports include Cost and usage report, Savings Plans utilization report, Savings Plans coverage report, reservation utilization report, and reservation coverage report.
* 	**Credits** AWS credits are applied to bills to help cover costs that are associated with eligible services. Credits are applied until they are exhausted or they expire.
* 	**Aws Pricing Calculator**: Configure a cost estimate that fits your unique business or personal needs with AWS products and services.
